This directory is where you place your statically served stylesheet, images, javascript, etc.
You can refer to files in these directories from html by prepending "/assets/project" in front of the directory
and file name. In other words, to display pic.jpg that is in the image directory, you can use the following html:

<img src="/assets/project/image/pic.jpg">

There are ways to serve up static files from other directories. But by default the system is designed to serve
these up in development mode, and easily deploy these when you are releasing.
