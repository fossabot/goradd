// Package control contains the implementations of the standard controls in goradd.
// These controls generally fall under the following categories:
// - Standard html tags. For example, div, input, select, table, img
// - Controls specifically designed to edit database data, like INT, FLOAT or DATE fields
// - Controls that we need to support the manipulation of database relationships, like one-to-many links
// - Useful utility controls
//
// Controls in this package should function and be usable even if javascript is turned off.
