This directory is managed by goradd generally. While you run your program in your development environment, the program will
copy files to this directory as you need them. Later, when you are ready to deploy, you will have all of your files in
one place. You can choose to concatenate them or minimize them at that point to improve performance. If you
concatenate them, be sure to register the master file in goradd and list the files it contains, so that goradd knows
to load the master file instead of the contained files.

If you want to add your own assets, put them in your project directory. They also will be copied to this directory
when your development environment uses them.

You can always place other files here too, that you just want to statically serve from your webpages. In particular,
you should place your image files in the image directory.
